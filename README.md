Madu and the Magic Mango Tree

Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a curious boy named Madu. Madu loved exploring the forests near his home. One day, while wandering deeper than usual, he found a magnificent mango tree unlike any he had ever seen. The tree was glowing softly, and its ripe mangoes shimmered with golden light.

Madu picked one mango and took a bite. Suddenly, he felt a warm rush of happiness and courage. The tree, sensing Madu’s kindness, spoke to him softly.

“Dear Madu, this is a magic mango tree. Whoever eats its fruit gains the power to help others and bring joy.”

Excited, Madu returned to his village and shared the mangoes with the people. As they ate, smiles brightened faces, and problems seemed easier to solve. Madu used his newfound courage to lead his village in planting more trees, sharing kindness and hope wherever he went.

From that day on, Madu wasn’t just a curious boy—he was a hero who spread magic through kindness and courage.
